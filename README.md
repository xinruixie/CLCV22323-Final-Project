# CLCV22323 Final Project (Supported Paper)
## About the project
As its name suggests, this project focus on the “Island of Women”, a half-fantastic, half-real entity in Japanese culture, which is typically portrayed as a place where the erotic demonic female---the obstruction on the path of Buddhist enlightenment---reside. Its cultural significance **appears twofold**: first, it is not only a recurring theme communicating the quintessential Buddhism message of enlightenment, but also a rather typical, simultaneous representation of male fantasy and fear --- a perpetuating ambivalent attitude towards the female and female body in Japanese patriarchal society.  Second, it frequently appeared on medieval maps, witnessed the evolution of cartography in Japan, from the realm of Buddhism to the secular, and from fantasy to the real world. It is both the textual and cartographical significance that makes a Digital Humanities project on this topic applicable. By creating a website collecting its related cultural resources, and thus demonstrating the two points above, this project aims to 
```
1) Provide some information for this under-researched, yet important cultural product;
2) Show how maps can resonate with texts, and the possible intertextuality if understanding cartography as a means of narrating cultural, religious, and moral values. 
```
In sections below, the project is specifically explained:

## Map🗺️
This section is one of the two visualization sections of the project. It presents an interactive map of Island of Women in the Japanese context and beyond, which is powered by **ERSI**, and developed by **ArcGIS online**. The purpose of this part is to bring the fantasy to the real world, since the Island of Women has been finally subsumed to an actual geographical entity (Hachijojima)---a temporal answer for the inaccuracy of cartography in the past, as well as for people’s longtime wonder of the periphery and liminality. It contains an information section, five sets of coordinates (seven sets if including the two historical layers) with their respective pop-ups (images are clickable), and six layers.

The process of development is simple yet complex: simple, it does not require many extra skills outside the syllabus, merely a procedure of `plotting`-`configuring pop-up`-`adjusting layers`-`configuring instant app`-`embedding the map`. Complex, there are much potential obstacles encountered in the course of developing, making the final demonstration not very ideal. For example, it was expected to show how the historical location of the island has changed, and how it gradually approached the contemporary version by creating several layers of old maps. However, many of them are completely not on the scale of the contemporary map, occasionally not even portrayed like a map. In this circumstance, georeference would not be a proper choice, since the goal is to make sense about the approximate historical locations rather than the panorama. In other words, only a certain part (i.e., the mainland part that is close to the island) of the map requires the particular attention. This, together with the **unknown incompatibility** between QGIS and ArcGIS (the georeferenced layers are made by QGIS, converted to vector layer, and finally exported as KML files), has made a simpler move & stretch method the most ideal solution for the two historical layers. Another obstacle came out in finding resources: while there are indeed some historical maps with this fantastical island that are on the scale, they are mostly in Dutch/Portuguese, and are only a small part of a larger atlas. To get a clear enough one and to decipher its annotation are, supposedly, not the work for this stage. I thus transverse the map to a worldwide scale to look at the Island of Women in other cultures, as an alternative to enrich the panorama of the map.![Georeference](https://github.com/xinruixie/CLCV22323-Final-Project/assets/146032222/4234cc45-248f-4d03-996c-68ea26bf940e)

Lastly, on the three layers about administrative division of Tokugawa Japan, which is seemingly irrelevant to the Island of Women. It is, for one thing, to set the scene of premodern Japan, where the Island of Women was extremely popular. But more importantly, this concerns with a future work --- mapping the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter in Tokyo, which was in inextricable connection with the Island of Women. It is expected to not only show its location, but also to recreate certain scenes that correlate with depictions of the Island of Women in contemporaneous literature. However, all these await further scrutiny. 

## Gallery🖼️
The gallery section serves as another visualization section. As explained above, those old maps that are not suitable for an interactive map are managed to be here. With similar purpose of demonstrating historical locations of the Island of Women, this section arranges scanned copies of the maps in the chronological manner, with their respective title and brief explanation. Endeavors made in this part are mainly some **JavaScript matters**: basically learned from W3 (for general knowledge about Java) and YouTube tutorials (to achieve the purpose specifically), the gallery box contains the most essential elements: 
```
1) `image variables` to specify all images used and `currentIndex` to manage current position of map images;
2) `shiftImage`, as its name suggests, to change images by clicking the `arrow`;
3) within `shiftImage`, the `setTimeout` to create a delaying animation of loading the next map, and `classList.add/remove` to manage the css.
```
By sliding maps in adjacent eras back and forth, viewers are allowed to quickly compare the different locations of the island, which is, for the current stage, the most intuitive way to compare & contrast changes of the Island of Women. With notes guiding to the exact location of the island on each map, it is also through this section that demonstrates how the maps evoked, and thus narrated the island’s liminality. 

## Documentation & Research📚
The Documentation goes in a very simple, purely textual way, with **one currently documented part and a ‘to be documented’ part**. Serving as textual grounds for the Island of Women, this section demonstrates all related passages from historical documents, with a primary categorization as explained. The coding is also quite basic: paragraphs, with font size slightly adjusted. More advanced arrangements would require actions by JavaScript, which is a bit **outside the scope** of this project. In developing this section, the time was mainly spent on finding and translating the excerpts rather than configuring the html code. It is however still important: this section deliberates more about the “humanities” side, and provides much idea for future works. For example, it prompts me to replenish scanned copies of original texts and thus make each one a single entry. Once this and the map section are fully configured, they are also expected to be interconnected, which is another intuitive way to show the intertextuality. The idea of building a storytelling section and add a glossary also stem from here。
>[!Note]
> The storytelling section is technically not difficult, the reason for me not complete it now is simply because I cannot access enough illustrations for storytelling --- those I showed during presentation cost nearly 3,000 bucks to get the photocopy).

The research section takes example by those digital tools in the syllabus---almost all of them have such a section expanding knowledge and resources on their topics. To make an applicable research page, it is broken down to several parts: Extended Readings for a more comprehensive understanding of the Island of Women as both a fantastic/realistic constructs, and its cultural messages; GIS resources for a wider range of mapping tools and collections; Reference for the major secondary (textual) supports for the current project. In technical terms, there is no special innovation but merely a grid container for each part. What I want to emphasize here is the learning from digital tools, about how they thoughtfully incorporate external resources, and how they achieve connectivity.
