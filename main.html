    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>In medieval Japanese Buddhism, the "Island of Women" presents a unique intersection of narrative, geography, and
      gender politics. This mystical island, often portrayed as an exotic, perilous, yet alluring realm, has long been a
      simultaneous representation of male fantasy and fear — it is inhabited exclusively by women, some of whom are
      sexually seductive at first but later becomes fatal. Stemming from the famous Buddhist setsuwa Konjaku Monogatari
      Shu, its textual ground narrates a story surrounding attachment and attainment, reminding people that the female,
      with their sexual potential, are obstructions on the road of enlightenment, and one can get attained only by
      withdrawing from pleasures of the world. The message is yet not only communicated by texts: this island, as a
      geographical entity, also frequently appeared on medieval maps, at the time when cartography was largely a
      Buddhist matter. It is always designed to be on the periphery of the map, delineating Japanese territory and the
      rest of the world, as well as implying the transgression from the world to the heavenly state. The Island of
      Women, as such, serves as a liminal space by many means, subtly yet everlastingly delivering the quintessential
      lesson of Buddhism.
      <br><br>
      D. Max Moerman, with his Demonology and Eroticism published in 2009, has completed a rather in-depth study on
      historical cartographies of the Island of Women. He identifies the island as "a conflicted site of desire and
      denial, of anxiety and alterity: a realm where the boundaries of religion and sexuality were encountered and
      explored. It lay forever at the margins of the known world, marking the furthest edge of cultural identity." It is
      rather dynamic, and has changed geographically and semantically over past centuries. While a wide range of maps
      are discussed and displayed to exemplify this idea throughout Moerman's work, he is, apparently, not able to give
      an exhaustive exhibition of them within 20-ish pages. Together with other issues such as the inaccessibility of
      certain age-old maps, the panorama of the Island of Women seems to remain ambiguous, and the narrative is still
      discursive.
      <br><br>
      My goal is, of course, not to challenge Moerman's intelligent studies. Rather, this website is inspired by, and
      developed upon his work, especially on his argument about "how cartography might be understood as a form of
      fiction". By collecting whatever cultural resources on the Island of Women here, this website endeavors to
      demonstrate 1) the intertextuality between map and literature, 2) how cartography, as a narrative device, can
      communicate cultural, moral, and religious messages. It is also hoped to expand understandings of the Island of
      Women beyond the Japanese context — there are much more similar constructions in other cultures worldwide,
      upholding somehow similar stories and intentions. Just like the title informed, it is not a study of cartography
      of the Island of Women, but cartography of male fantasy.

      The Great Country of Japan is the island that was formed when the brine from the heavenly spear fell into the seas
      of Jambudvīpa (Nanbudai 南浮提). The country of Japan is Cāmara (Shamara 遮末羅), one of the two islands south of
      Jambudvīpa. According to the Abhidharmakośa, this island is inhabited by rākṣasī (rasetsuba 羅刹婆) but in truth the
      rākṣasī are [Amaterasu, the deity of] the Ise shrine, who is the manifestation (suijaku 垂迹) of Dainichi.<br><br>

      <b>Shanhaijing 山海経 (Classic of mountains and seas)</b><br>
      The Land of Women lies north of the Land of Shaman Zian. Two women dwell here in the water, which surrounds
      them.<br><br>

      <b>Haedong cheguk ki 海東諸国紀</b><br>
      It is 70 ri from here to the capital and 70 ri to Rasetsukoku 此国都七十里至羅刹国七十里. The Land of Women, which lies between
      Rasetsukoku and the mainland, is located with a similar degree of specificity: distance to Mutsu 13 ri

      The Land of Women is in the southeastern seas. The water flows to the east. Lotus flowers one foot across bloom
      once a year and the peaches have stones two feet long. Long ago a ship drifted there and the women gathered
      together and carried the ship off. The sailors were all close to death. But a clever man among them stole the boat
      back at night and they were able to escape. The women conceive children by exposing their genitals to the south
      wind. According to others, the women become pregnant by looking at their reflection in a well.<br><br>

      This land is in the northeastern seas. There are no boys in this land. When young boys come here they never
      return. The women look at their reflection in a well and immediately become pregnant. They give birth only to
      girls.<br><br>

      <b>Fūryū Shidōken den 風流志道軒傳</b><br>
      It was the Island of Women, a country inhabited only by women. There wasn’t a single man on the entire island.
      When the women here wanted to have a child, they opened their robes and faced in the direction of Japan. Wind blew
      on their bodies and made them pregnant, and later they bore girl babies. They had a ruler, but it was always a
      woman.<br><br>
